THis is the where i'm learning to use the git and the github together, nice and fun feels like i'm getting technical, tech savvy kind of person
used the terminal code -"git config --global core.editor "code --wait""  , so to be able to write just git commit instead of writing whole git commit -m "the commit msg", something Vim was mentioned which is an editor more known for productivity
